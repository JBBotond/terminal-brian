You can open Brian by cd -ing into the folder and running ./brian. <br>
Make sure Brian is executable (chown {username} brian) <br>
You can make him:
  <ul>
  <li>wave by typing "wave"</li>
  <li>jump by typing "jump"</li>
  <li>exit by typing "exit"</li>li>
  </ul>
  <br>
    -you can also follow up with "-{integer}" to tell him how many times to perform an action <br>
    -ex.: wave -3 (he will wave 3 times) <br>
